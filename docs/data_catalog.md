## âœ… Overview: Gold Layer in Data Catalog

The **Gold Layer** represents the **business-ready** data in a modern data architecture.  
It is the final curated layer in the data pipeline, where data is **cleaned, transformed, joined**, and **modeled** to support analytical use cases.

- **Fact tables**: Contain quantitative metrics and business events (e.g., `sales_amount`, `quantity`, `price`).
- **Dimension tables**: Contain descriptive attributes used to filter, group, or label facts (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `date`).
