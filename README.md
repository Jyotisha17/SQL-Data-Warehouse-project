## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project uses the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data from source systems (CSV files) is ingested into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer:** Data is cleaned, standardized, and transformed for analysis.
- **Gold Layer:** Business-ready data modeled in a star schema format for reporting and analytics.
